            <li>I am building a Shopify Store with a Midwest theme.</li>
            <li>I am creating Gigtor with talented people from around the world to help venues and artist connect more seamlessly.</li>

- :speech_balloon: Ask me about anything React/JavaScript.
- :evergreen_tree: I enjoy being in the outdoors. There's nothing quite like the feeling of being surrounded by nature, whether it's hiking through a forest or watching a stunning sunrise or sunset over the lake.
