👋 Hi there! I'm Anthony Stolp, a passionate software engineer with a focus on building responsive and accessible web applications using React and TypeScript, and other fronend frameworks. I'm committed to creating digital experiences that are inclusive and user-friendly.

🛠️ Currently, I'm working on enhancing website accessibility to ensure everyone can access and use the content seamlessly. I believe in the power of technology to bridge gaps and create a more inclusive digital world.

🌱 When I'm not coding, I enjoy being outdoors, and I'm always eager to learn new things and collaborate on exciting projects.

Feel free to explore my repositories and get in touch. Let's connect and make the web a better place for everyone!
